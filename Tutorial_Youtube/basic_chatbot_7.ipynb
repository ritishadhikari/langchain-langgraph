His law was initially met with skepticism but laid the groundwork for later developments.\\n\\n2. **Julius Lothar Meyer** (1830-1895): A German chemist who independently developed a periodic table in the late 1860s and early 1870s.

His predictions about undiscovered elements were later confirmed, and his work remains an essential foundation of modern chemistry.\\n\\nWhile the question of who \"invented\" the periodic table is a matter of interpretation, Dmitri Mendeleev is often credited with creating the most influential and enduring version of the table, and his contributions have had a lasting impact on the field of chemistry.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 335, 'prompt_tokens': 41, 'total_tokens': 376, 'completion_time': 0.533427657, 'prompt_time': 0.00197908, 'queue_time': 0.04955759, 'total_time': 0.535406737}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_4387d3edbb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--f71e9a38-2f79-4ab9-b158-fdccea0f007c-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 41, 'output_tokens': 335, 'total_tokens': 376})]}\n",
