Reflexion Agents in Langgraph:
    - The main component is the actor
    - It is the main agent that drives everything - it reflects on its 
    responses and re-executes
    - It can do this with or without tools to improve based on self-critique
    that is grounded in external data
    - It's main subcomponent includes:
        - tools/tool execution
        - initial responder: generate an initial response & self reflection
        - revisor: re-respond and reflect based on previous reflections
    - Episodic Memory:
        - This memory refers to an agent's ability to recall specific past 
        interactions, events or experiences rather than just generalized knowledge
        - This is crucial for making agents feel more context-aware, personalized,
        and human-like over time
