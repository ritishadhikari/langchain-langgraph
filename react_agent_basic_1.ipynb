      "Final Answer: The Indian government should strengthen existing counter-terrorism strategies by enhancing intelligence gathering, border security, and cybersecurity measures. It should also address radicalization, foster international cooperation, engage communities, and implement rehabilitation programs. Furthermore, the government should address the root causes of terrorism through long-term socio-economic development initiatives. Experts emphasize the need for evolving counter-terrorism mechanisms, enhanced operational coordination, and addressing the blurred lines between counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism.\u001b[0m\n",
